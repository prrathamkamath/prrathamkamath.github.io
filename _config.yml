  bio: "Shaped by a business family where conversations revolved around markets, margins, and momentum. That environment led me to spot early signs of growth and understand what makes a business commercially meaningful. Over time, I have carved out a niche at the intersection of brand building, growth marketing, and business fundamentals, the place where storytelling meets strategy and where positioning directly impacts business performance. I want to build a career helping startups grow through sharp messaging, scalable go-to-market systems, and a deep understanding of how markets behave."

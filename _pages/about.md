## About Me

I’m **Prratham Kamat** and someone once told me that the smartest way to succeed is to work insanely hard. I’ve tried to live by that ever since. Ever since I can remember, I did things differently: selling apparel, flipping water bottles for twice the price at concerts, even building websites at 17 just to make that extra buck. These early hustles did two things for me — they sharpened my curiosity about how businesses work and built a hunger to eventually create something meaningful for people. This pursuit of trying different ventures naturally led me into marketing.

But more than just working hard, I realised it’s crucial to pick the right things to focus on. I chose a path of experimentation over the traditional IIT-JEE route because I knew I wouldn’t thrive as an engineer. Instead, I focused on ventures and experiences that let me learn by doing, test ideas in the real world, and develop skills that truly mattered. I said fuck it to IIT-JEE and did a Bachelor’s in Economics from Christ University. It was my “Farhan moment” from 3 Idiots. Studying economics gave me clarity on how markets behave, how decisions shape outcomes, and how businesses grow (or don’t).

In my third year, I built a marketing outreach agency that I scaled to a profitable margin. I designed and executed multi-channel outreach campaigns for tech, consulting, and HR B2B clients — consistently achieving 70–80% open rates and 3–4% reply rates across large-scale prospect lists. Soon, my agency and consulting services were paying me far more than any company visiting campus, so I didn’t sit for placements.

I later worked as a Marketing Consultant at Ticombo, a European secondary ticketing company. That role exposed me to the entire marketing spectrum, from SEO long-form content pipelines to market analysis, brand narrative building, influencer-led campaigns, and creator partnerships for major events.

Every great thing ever built was built because someone had a vision, deep passion for it, and the willingness to go through short-term pain, the kind of "struggle" that compounds multifold over time. I am looking for a place where I can contribute to that kind of vision, grow fast, solve exciting problems, and be part of a team that believes in shared success.
